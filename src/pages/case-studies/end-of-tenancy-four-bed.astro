        <h2 class="font-heading font-bold text-xl text-navy mt-8 mb-3">The Brief</h2>
        <p>A letting agent called us with 48 hours' notice. Their previous cleaning company had cancelled, and they had an inventory checkout booked the following afternoon. The property was a four-bedroom detached house with two bathrooms, a large kitchen and carpets throughout the ground floor.</p>
        <h2 class="font-heading font-bold text-xl text-navy mt-8 mb-3">What We Did</h2>
        <p>A three-person team arrived at 8am. We split the work: one on the kitchen (oven, hob, extractor, fridge, all surfaces), one on both bathrooms (descaling, grouting, chrome, glass), and one handling carpets and general cleaning across the bedrooms and living areas.</p>
        <p>By early afternoon, every room had been cleaned from ceiling to floor. Carpets were shampooed, windows done inside, skirting boards wiped, and all light switches and door handles sanitised.</p>
        <h2 class="font-heading font-bold text-xl text-navy mt-8 mb-3">The Result</h2>
        <p>The checkout inspection passed without a single item flagged. The letting agent now uses us for all their managed properties in the Epsom area.</p>

        <h2 class="font-heading font-bold text-xl text-navy mt-8 mb-3">The Brief</h2>
        <p>A technology company in Leatherhead was unhappy with their existing cleaning contractor. Bins were missed, kitchens left dirty, and complaints from staff were piling up. They wanted a fresh start with a company that would actually turn up and do the job properly.</p>
        <h2 class="font-heading font-bold text-xl text-navy mt-8 mb-3">What We Did</h2>
        <p>We carried out a site visit, walked through the space with the office manager, and put together a cleaning schedule tailored to their needs. The office has 3,000 square feet across two floors, with a communal kitchen, four meeting rooms and two washrooms.</p>
        <p>Our team cleans every Monday and Thursday evening between 6pm and 9pm. The scope includes vacuuming, mopping, desk and surface wiping, kitchen cleaning, washroom deep-clean, bin emptying and recycling.</p>
        <h2 class="font-heading font-bold text-xl text-navy mt-8 mb-3">The Result</h2>
        <p>Staff complaints stopped within the first week. The office manager said the difference was "night and day." We have been on-site twice a week for over a year now, and the contract has been extended with no price increase.</p>

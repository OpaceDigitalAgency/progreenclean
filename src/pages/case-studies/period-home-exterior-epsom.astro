        <h2 class="font-heading font-bold text-xl text-navy mt-8 mb-3">The Brief</h2>
        <p>A homeowner in central Epsom had a Victorian semi that had not had a proper exterior clean in over three years. The gutters were overflowing, the driveway was covered in moss, and the windows had a permanent haze from hard-water deposits.</p>
        <h2 class="font-heading font-bold text-xl text-navy mt-8 mb-3">What We Did</h2>
        <p>Day one focused on the windows and gutters. We used our water-fed pole system on all windows — front, back and side — removing hard-water marks and years of built-up grime. The SkyVac cleared compacted leaf debris from every gutter run, and we flushed all downpipes.</p>
        <p>Day two was the driveway. We pressure-washed the entire block-paved area, lifted the moss and dirt, then re-sanded the joints with kiln-dried sand.</p>
        <h2 class="font-heading font-bold text-xl text-navy mt-8 mb-3">The Result</h2>
        <p>The homeowner said the house looked "like it did when we first moved in." The gutters drain properly, the windows are streak-free, and the driveway looks brand new. They have since booked a regular six-weekly window clean.</p>

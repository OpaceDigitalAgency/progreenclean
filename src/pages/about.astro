            Our Story
          </h2>
          <p class="text-navy/70 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            ProGreen Clean grew out of a straightforward idea: local people
            deserve reliable, honest cleaning services that actually deliver.
            What began as one person with a van in Epsom has grown into a
            trusted team covering Surrey and beyond.
          </p>
          <p class="text-navy/70 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            We got fed up with hearing the same complaints — missed
            appointments, sloppy work, hidden charges. So we set out to do
            things differently. We turn up when we say we will, we charge what
            we quote, and we do not leave a job half-finished.
          </p>
          <p class="text-navy/70 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Every product we use is chosen for performance and environmental
            impact. We favour water-fed pole systems over harsh chemicals,
            biodegradable solutions over bleach, and careful hand-work over
            rushed results.
          </p>
          <p class="text-navy/70 leading-relaxed">
            We are still family-run, still based in Epsom, and still answer the
            phone ourselves. That is how we like it.
          </p>

          Gutters are one of those things you never think about until something
          goes wrong. And by that point, the damage can be expensive. Here are
          five red flags that mean you should get them checked.
        </p>
        <h2 class="font-heading font-bold text-xl text-navy mt-8 mb-3">
          1. Water Spilling Over the Sides
        </h2>
        <p>
          During rain, water should flow through the gutter and down the
          drainpipe. If it is pouring over the edge like a waterfall, something
          is blocking the channel. Leaves, moss and bird nests are the usual
          culprits.
        </p>
        <h2 class="font-heading font-bold text-xl text-navy mt-8 mb-3">
          2. Plants Growing in the Gutter
        </h2>
        <p>
          If you can see weeds or even small plants sprouting from your gutter
          line, there is enough compacted debris up there to act as soil. That
          is a clear sign things have been left too long.
        </p>
        <h2 class="font-heading font-bold text-xl text-navy mt-8 mb-3">
          3. Staining on External Walls
        </h2>
        <p>
          Green or brown streaks running down your brickwork usually mean water
          is overflowing and sitting against the wall. Left unchecked, this
          leads to damp penetration and interior damage.
        </p>
        <h2 class="font-heading font-bold text-xl text-navy mt-8 mb-3">
          4. Sagging Gutters
        </h2>
        <p>
          Gutters that dip or pull away from the fascia are carrying too much
          weight. Wet debris is surprisingly heavy, and it puts strain on
          brackets and joints.
        </p>
        <h2 class="font-heading font-bold text-xl text-navy mt-8 mb-3">
          5. Damp Patches Inside
        </h2>
        <p>
          If you have noticed damp on internal walls near the roofline, blocked
          gutters could be the cause. Water finds the path of least resistance,
          and a full gutter pushes moisture into places it should never reach.
        </p>
        <h2 class="font-heading font-bold text-xl text-navy mt-8 mb-3">
          What to Do About It
        </h2>
        <p>
          Book a gutter clean before the problem gets worse. Our SkyVac system
          clears everything from ground level — no ladders, no fuss. We also
          inspect joints and downpipes as part of every clean, so you will know
          exactly what condition your gutters are in.

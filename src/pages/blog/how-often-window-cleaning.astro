          There is no single right answer, because it depends on where you live,
          how exposed your windows are, and what kind of property you have got.
          But here is what we have learned from a decade of cleaning windows
          across Surrey.
        </p>
        <h2 class="font-heading font-bold text-xl text-navy mt-8 mb-3">
          Residential Properties
        </h2>
        <p>
          For most homes, every four to six weeks hits the sweet spot. That is
          frequent enough to stop grime building up, but not so often that you
          are spending money for no visible improvement. If your house is next
          to a busy road or surrounded by trees, you might want to move closer
          to the four-week end.
        </p>
        <h2 class="font-heading font-bold text-xl text-navy mt-8 mb-3">
          Commercial Properties
        </h2>
        <p>
          First impressions count. A shop front or office with dirty windows
          does not exactly scream "professional." Most of our commercial clients
          book monthly cleans, though high-footfall locations like restaurants
          and estate agents sometimes ask for fortnightly.
        </p>
        <h2 class="font-heading font-bold text-xl text-navy mt-8 mb-3">
          What Happens If You Leave It Too Long?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Hard-water staining is the big one. When mineral deposits sit on glass
          for months, they etch into the surface and become permanently visible.
          Regular cleaning prevents that. You also get less mould around frames
          and seals, which keeps everything looking — and smelling — fresher.
        </p>
        <h2 class="font-heading font-bold text-xl text-navy mt-8 mb-3">
          Our Recommendation
        </h2>
        <p>
          Book a regular schedule and stick to it. We offer four-weekly and
          six-weekly packages at competitive rates, and you can cancel or pause
          whenever you like. Once you see the difference consistent cleaning
          makes, you will wonder why you ever left it.
